# About Me

Hi! I'm Ben. I'm a Software developer who has been building websites since 2003. In a past lifetime, I built a website called "The Dawn of Time" using LAMP (PHP) and JavaScript, and did many years of freelance work after graduating from University.

I also worked abroad teaching ESL for 5 years which gave me a love of teaching.

Since 2014, I've been primarily a JavaScript/TypeScript developer. I've done backend and frontend work, and I've worked in many industries from FinTech, Digital Agencies, Innovation Labs and Start Ups.

Now, I want to share my love of learning and programming to help you learn how to leverage these powerful tools to your advantage.
