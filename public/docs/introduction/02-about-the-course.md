# About the course

This course is intended to focus on everything from the ground up. This will also serve as reference material for all the obscure/fringe topics that will invariably come up during our studies.

Most of the programming knowledge I have is either self taught from documentation, or from online courses like this one you're about to take. I've been in your shoes and I know the struggles of learning something brand new and the obstacles and frustration that can come with it.
