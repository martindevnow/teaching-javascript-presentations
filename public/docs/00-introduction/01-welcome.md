## Welcome

Hi! My name is Ben and I'm a Software developer.

![Hello!](/docs/gifs/hello-bear.gif)

Notes:
I've been building websites since 2003. In a past lifetime, I built a website called "The Dawn of Time" using LAMP (PHP) and JavaScript, and did many years of freelance work after graduating from University.

---

I also worked abroad teaching ESL for 5 years which gave me a love of teaching.

---

Since 2014, I've been primarily a JavaScript/TypeScript developer. I've done backend and frontend work, and I've worked in many industries from FinTech, Digital Agencies, Innovation Labs and Start Ups.

---

Now, I want to share my love of learning and programming to help you learn how to leverage these powerful tools to your advantage.

## What we will learn

In this course we will cover not only the JavaScript basics, but we will also dive into complex situations you're likely to encounter as a professional software developer.

Notes:
Understanding the intricacies of how JavaScript works and runs in the browser and on the server is vital to be able to debug issues that will arise in later sections.

## Hands On

But this course isn't all theory and syntax. We will take the fundamentals and put them into practice by solving real-world problems.
