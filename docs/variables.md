# Variables

What is a variable?

A variable is like a little box that we give a name to reference what we put in it.

Variables are instantiated (putting a label on a box) and initialized (putting contents into that box)

The _label_ we give the variable (box) is what we will call the `(variable's) name`

The _type_ of contents of the variable (box) are what we will call the `(variable's) type` and the actual contents themselves is the `(variable's) value`

---

For example, in JavaScript, a variable is instantiated and initialized in a single line of code as follows:

```js
let age = 30;
```

Some aspects of this instantiation and initialization are implicit and others are explicit.

We are explicitly setting the `name` to be `age` and the `value` to be `30`, but we are implicitly telling the computer that the `type` is `number`

@TODO: Add a link to the session where data types are covered
